# How to contribute

## Reporting issues

Bugs, feature requests, and development-related questions should be directed to our GitHub issue tracker. If reporting a bug, please try and provide as much context as possible such as your operating system, Go version, and anything else that might be relevant to the bug. For feature requests, please explain what you're trying to do, and how the requested feature would help you do that.

## Pull Request

We don't currently accept pull requests from the public. They will be automatically closed. If you would like to make a proposal, we will do our best to review it, implement it ourselves, and include it in the next release. If enough proposals come through, we will certainly revisit this policy to make the package as useful as possible.
